# Baldur's Gate 3 Level Cap Extender
Baldur's Gate 3 has 12 levels, each of which has a required number of experience points to reach. The maximum level cap is 12. Level 12 requires a total of 100,000 experience points. This is a very low number considering the vast amounts of XP available in the game, especially in Acts 2 & 3. This means party stagnation for the majority of players, which is fine if you're fine with it. If you're not, however, level-capping can be frustrating and kill sense of purpose.

Level Cap Extender addresses that deficiency by providing 5 options:

> Doubled (200K MAX XP)
> Tripled (300K MAX XP)
> Quadrupled (400K MAX XP)
> Quintupled (500K MAX XP)
> Sextupled (600K MAX XP)

Doubled is for diving somewhat deeper than on a casual playthrough, hitting the level-cap sometime before reaching halfway in Act 3. Sextupled would be for your anal-retentive completionist who must finish every quest and take on every possible enemy. Yours truly, for instance. You won't hit the level cap until very late in the game, if ever.

If you're a completionist yet not anal-retentive and want to hit the level cap late, quintupled should suffice. Expect to level-cap not too long before the final battle.

Note that Level Cap Extender doesn't change the number of levels or mess with the treasure table. It merely modifies the the experience points each level requires and by extension, the total experience points.

The goal: more challenging gameplay while delaying the level cap.

Note also that Level Cap Extender will work with any version of Baldur's Gate 3, but it will conflict with any other mod that utilizes Data.txt and XPData.txt. It should, however, be compatible with any mod that leaves the aforementioned files alone.

My most recent playthrough includes the following mods using Patch 6 with the latest hot fix and runs without issue:

> Tactician Plus
> Highlight Everything Revised
> No More Dirt and Blood
> Bags, Bags, Bags
> Better Containers
> Enemies Enhanced
> Aether's Immersive UI
> Improved UI
> Native Mod Loader
> Native Camera Tweaks
> Party Limit Begone
> Show Approval Ratings

As for installing, that's easy. Download and extract the zip. Run LevelCapExtenderInstaller.msi to install. Run the program, select your game file, and choose which Level Extender you want to run. That's it. No files to find, copy and no directories to find and paste into.

As for uninstalling XP changes, simply choose Uninstall from the Level Extender options and the app will revert BG 3 to the vanilla experience table.

If you wish to upgrade XP tables to a higher level cap, run Level Cap Extender and choose a higher XP requirement. I wouldn't recommend that past Level 3, however. If you're far into the game, changing XP tables might muck with the levels of your characters.

If you wish to uninstall Level Cap Extender from Windows, go to Add or Remove Programs.
